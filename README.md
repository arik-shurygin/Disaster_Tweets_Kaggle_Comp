# Disaster_Tweets_Kaggle_Comp
My submission to the "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/leaderboard#)

This submission placed in the top 15% of participants at the time of completion, recieving a test accuracy of 82.8%. 

I do not own the data this model was built on top of, nor the BERT framework, no licenses are implied. This repo is purely to show my abilities as a Machine Learning Engineer / AI researcher.
